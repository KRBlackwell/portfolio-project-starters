# portfolio-project-starters
These are ideas for projects, already in a code format, with prompting questions. They are meant to give you the momentum to start coding.

Google Colab notebooks make it easy for you to copy a starter into your own Google Drive and change it how you want.

## Data analysis on the National Register of Historic Places
[National Register of Historic Places Project Starter Notebook](https://github.com/KRBlackwell/portfolio-project-starters/blob/main/Portfolio%20Starter%20Python%20National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places.ipynb)\

This project can take you in so many directions. Use your imagination and start exploring the data. There are opportunities here to bring in Census population data, and data near you or your favorite historic sites.\
Here is a completed example if you need more help: [National Register of Historic Places](https://github.com/KRBlackwell/portfolio-project-starters/blob/main/Portfolio_Starter_Python_National_Register_of_Historic_Places_Example.ipynb)\

## Sqlite3 create database and trigger, example of using a pandas dataframe and to_sql

With sqlite3, you need to specify SQL statements.

## SQLAlchemy example using a pandas dataframe

This is a good starter if you need a database and have an input file. Pandas can read different types of data files into a dataframe, and SQLAlchemy has an ORM that you can use to get the data into the database. What would you do to rename a bunch of dataframe columns to match what you want in the target databse?
