These are ideas for projects, already in a code format, with prompting questions. They are meant to give you the momentum to start coding.

## Data analysis on the National Register of Historic Places
[National Register of Historic Places Project Starter Notebook] (https://github.com/KRBlackwell/portfolio-project-starters/blob/main/Portfolio%20Starter%20Python%20National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places.ipynb)
This project can take you in so many directions. Use your imagination and start exploring the data. There are opportunities here to bring in Census population data, and data near you or your favorite historic sites.
